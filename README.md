Things now working: Liking only selects one, Send feedback, back button clicks, toast for clear favorites, search loading on top of main menu after going into landscape, back button from recipe, previous results cleared, smaller favorite button, consistent background, deeper red (same red as McDonalds), one toggle instead of 2, custom app icon

Things not changed: no custom recipe- unfortunately that would be a project unto itself because our api doesn't take in input properly for a new recipe, Pics not displaying properly-some pics are not in the database and you get the tray picture the flickering we are not exactly sure why that is happening but believe it has to do with getting the images in the background asynchronously, pics still large in recipe page- we weren't really sure why we should make it smaller and like the way it looks currently anyway else looks awkward

Functionalitly-wise everything should work perfectly other than the flickering images

There is a problem where no dicrections for a recipe show up, that is an api issue and not ours, the recipe has no instructions in their database
